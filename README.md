# Chatty AI

Chatty AI Backend is a Node.js application designed to leverage AI-powered conversational capabilities provided by Gradio's `CodeGemma` API. This backend serves as an intermediary layer, processing requests from a frontend application and interfacing with Gradio to generate responses based on user input. This setup allows developers to integrate sophisticated AI responses into applications without direct interaction with complex AI models.
